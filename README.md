#ETHassessment 
Presenting a simple Solidity smart contract that represents a token with necessary functions such as token burning and minting.

##Description
This program is a contract written in Solidity, a programming language used for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.It demonstrates various concepts taught in the ETH Beginner Course. The contract includes public variables for storing token details, a mapping to associate addresses with balances, a mint function that accepts an address and a value as parameters, and a burn function.

##Getting started and Code
To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/. Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., eth.sol). Copy and paste the following code into the file:
